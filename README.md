**Load Timebees extension on Chrome following:**
   ###### 1. Access `chrome://extensions/`
   ###### 2. Check `Developer mode`
   ###### 3. Click on `Load unpacked extension`
   ###### 4. Select the `build` folder.

**After the development of your extension run the command**

```
$ NODE_ENV=production npm run build
```

Now, the content of `build` folder will be the extension ready to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store. Just take a look at the [official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) to more infos about publishing.

## Secrets

It's a good practice you not commit your secret keys and expose to anyone that have access to the repository.

Import the file `./secrets.<THE-NODE_ENV>.js` on your modules through the module named as `secrets`, so you can do things like this:

_./secrets.development.js_

```js
export default { key: "123" };
```

_./src/popup.js_

```js
import secrets from "secrets";
ApiCall({ key: secrets.key });
```

ðŸ‘‰ The files with name `secrets.*.js` already are ignored on the repository.
